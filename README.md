# Ruby-Game
This was a student group project for my programming languages class with Prof. Fitzsimmons. We made a game called recursive descent.
To run the game, you need a ruby environment on your system. Run Recursive_Descent.rb in the folder with all of the files.
My group members were Kyle Culley and Tristan Silero.
